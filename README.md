### 설명

> 알고리즘 문제 해결 능력의 향상을 위해 이 책을 이용하였습니다. 이 책에서는 프로그래밍 대회에 초점을 맞춰 설명하고 있는 책이지만, 알고리즘을 학습하고 상상력과 사고력을 키우는데 아주 재미있는 책이라고 생각합니다. 지은이는 C++ 언어를 이용하여 알고리즘을 구성하고, 설명하고 있지만 필자는 node 언어와 javascript를 통해 알고리즘을 구현하고 재해석하여 코딩하고 있습니다. 책에서는 C++ 표준 라이브러리와 비트 연산 등 특정 언어에 관련된 문법들도 소개시켜주기 때문에 이러한 내용들을 제외하고, 일부 구현하기 힘들거나 알고리즘을 구현하기 귀찮을 내용일 때의 내용도 제외하고 코딩하였습니다. <br>

> This invaluable textbook presents a comprehensive introduction to modern competitive programming. The text highlights how competitive programming has proven to be an excellent way to learn algorithms, by encouraging the design of algorithms that actually work, stimulating the improvement of programming and debugging skills, and reinforcing the type of thinking required to solve problems in a competitive setting. The book contains many “folklore” algorithm design tricks that are known by experienced competitive programmers, yet which have previously only been formally discussed in online forums and blog posts.

> Topics and features: reviews the features of the C++ programming language, and describes how to create efficient algorithms that can quickly process large data sets; discusses sorting algorithms and binary search, and examines a selection of data structures of the C++ standard library; introduces the algorithm design technique of dynamic programming, and investigates elementary graph algorithms; covers such advanced algorithm design topics as bit-parallelism and amortized analysis, and presents a focus on efficiently processing array range queries; surveys specialized algorithms for trees, and discusses the mathematical topics that are relevant in competitive programming; examines advanced graph techniques, geometric algorithms, and string techniques; describes a selection of more advanced topics, including square root algorithms and dynamic programming optimization. This easy-to-follow guide is an ideal reference for all students wishing to learn algorithms, and practice for programming contests. Knowledge of the basics of programming is assumed, but previous background in algorithm design or programming contests is not necessary. Due to the broad range of topics covered at various levels of difficulty, this book is suitable for both beginners and more experienced readers.
